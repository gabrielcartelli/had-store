# Hat Store Training Frontend

This directory contains the frontend part of the Hat Store Training project. The frontend is responsible for displaying the product listing of hats, managing the shopping cart, and facilitating the checkout process.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that structures the webpage and links to CSS and JavaScript files.
- **css/styles.css**: Contains styles for the frontend application, defining the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects.
- **js/app.js**: Contains JavaScript code that handles user interactions, such as adding hats to the cart, updating quantities, calculating totals, and managing the checkout process.

## Setup Instructions

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the application.
2. Ensure that the backend server is running to handle API requests for product listings and cart operations.

## Usage

- Browse the available hats and add them to your shopping cart.
- Adjust quantities as needed and view the total purchase amount.
- Proceed to checkout and select your preferred payment method (Pix or boleto).
